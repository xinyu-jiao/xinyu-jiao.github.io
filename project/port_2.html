        <p>As one of the three major ecosystems in the world, wetland refers to natural or artificial, perennial or seasonal water areas and water with significant ecological functions, including sea areas with a depth of more than six metres at low tide. Wetlands are natural or artificial, perennial or seasonal water areas and water with significant ecological functions, including sea areas with a depth of up to six meters at low tide.</p>
        
        <p>Globally, 6% of the world's wetlands provide habitat for 40% of the world's wildlife. Wetlands provide a home for 40% of all wildlife, and more than 1 billion people around the world depend on them for their livelihoods. Wetlands are known as the "kidneys of the earth" and have important ecological functions such as water conservation, water purification, maintenance of biodiversity, flood and drought control, climate regulation and carbon sequestration. In addition, they also play a important role in environmental, economical and social service functions.</p>

        <p>The current situation of the conservation of wetlands globally is bleak. Wetlands are disappearing three times faster than forests, and nearly 90% of the world's wetlands, including rivers, lakes, marshes and peatlands, have been lost.</p>
