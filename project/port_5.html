        <p>In airports and stations, people always have a lot of carry-on luggage during waiting for departure, which will become very inconvenient when people want to leave their seats to go to the lavatory or hang around.</p>
        
        <p>In this service system, I designed two ways of luggage deposit.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>One is in the instant deposit area of the lavatory and water room. You can immediately get a corresponding card after lock your luggage.</li>
            <li>The other is a luggage deposit center designed for passengers waiting for a long time, which needs to be used in conjunction with self-service machines and mobile apps.</li>
